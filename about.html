                </div>
                <p>I was born on February 21st, 2003 in the city of Monrovia. I lived with 
                    my Mom, <b>Evangeline R. Garway</b>; my two sisters, <b>Courgae R. Weedy</b> and <b>Evon S.B. Weedy</b> on 26th Street 
                    Sinkor Tubman Boulevard, Monrovia.
                    Courage is a sweet older sister and would do anything when Mommy is not 
                    around for us. Evon my younger sister acts like sheâ€™s the owner of the house.
                    I loved both my sisters. <br>
                    Coming up at the age of 14yrs, in the year 2017 May, I lost my dad in the 
                    cold hands of death in a painful manner. Our Dad means everything to us 
                    likewise our Mom, since his demised, everything has been on the opposite 
                    side for us.
                    But there is one hope that kept us where we are today and that opens the 
                    curtain of caring and lovely Mother, since my dad pass on, this eloquent, 
                    kindhearted, benevolent lady <b>(Ms. Evangeline R. Garway),</b> has served in both of the position in our 
                    lives up till this time. Being a single parent especially in this 
                    dispensation.
                    It takes the grace of God that continue to lead my mom in giving us that 
                    father and mother love and care.
                    My mom is a drop out college student due to low finance and support from 
                    other relatives and loved ones, she owns a boutique known as <I>Evon's Classic Fashion</I>
                    in providing a suitbale care for her children to survive, still healthy and always be in School.
